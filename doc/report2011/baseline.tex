\title{Moving Object Pipeline System Design}

\author{Jonathan Myers, Lynne Jones, Tim Axelrod}

\begin{abstract}

The Moving Object Pipeline System (MOPS) has two responsibilities
within LSST Data Management.  First, it is responsible for generating
and managing the \textbf{Moving Object} data products.  The Moving
Objects are identified solar system objects with associated Keplerian
orbits, errors, and detected sources associated with those solar
system objects.  The second responsibility of the MOPS is to predict
future locations of moving objects in incoming images so that their
sources may be associated with known objects; this will reduce the
number of transient detections and prevent Alert Generation on
detections of known Solar System objects.

% so jeff larsen gave me a list of references as \bibitems.  our other
% references are bibtex format.  So we now have two bibliographies!
% ugly! hopefully no one will particularly care.
